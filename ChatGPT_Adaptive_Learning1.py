# Me: Can you show me a python code related to adaptive learning?
# ChatGPT:
# Sure, here's an example of a Python code for implementing a simple adaptive learning system using the scikit-learn library:

from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Training data
X_train = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]]
y_train = [0, 1, 1, 0]

# Initialize the model
clf = Perceptron(tol=1e-3)

# Train the model on the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test data
X_test = [[1, 1], [0, 0]]
y_test = [1, 0]

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", acc)

# Update the model with new data
X_update = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]
y_update = [1, 1, 0]
clf.partial_fit(X_update, y_update)

# Make predictions on the updated data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the updated accuracy
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Updated accuracy:", acc)



# This code uses the Perceptron algorithm from scikit-learn to train a simple binary classifier on a small dataset. The clf.fit() method is used to train the model on the training data, and the clf.predict() method is used to make predictions on the test data. The accuracy of the model is calculated using the accuracy_score() function from scikit-learn.
# The code then uses the clf.partial_fit() method to update the model with new data.
