# Me: Can you show me a python code related to adaptive learning?
# ChatGPT:
# Sure, here is an example of a Python code for implementing an adaptive learning algorithm using the scikit-learn library:


from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=4, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=0, shuffle=False)

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=0)

# Initialize the model
clf = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=50, learning_rate=1)

# Train the model on the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", acc)

# Update the model with new data
X_update, y_update = make_classification(n_samples=200, n_features=4, n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, random_state=0, shuffle=False)

clf.fit(X_update, y_update)

# Make predictions on the updated data
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the updated accuracy
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Updated accuracy:", acc)


# In this example, the AdaBoost Classifier algorithm is used to classify a sample dataset. The clf.fit() method is used to train the model on the training data, and the clf.predict() method is used to make predictions on the test data. The accuracy of the model is calculated using the accuracy_score() function from scikit-learn.
# The code then uses the clf.fit() method to update the model with new data, and the updated accuracy is calculated again. The AdaBoost algorithm is a type of ensemble method that creates a strong classifier by combining several weak classifiers, in this case decision trees. The algorithm adapts to the data by adjusting the weight of each decision tree at each iteration
